# Changelog

All notable changes to clings will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`someday`/`anytime`/etc. list drift from Things**: `ThingsDatabase` list queries (`fetchList`, `search`) no longer include Things' internal repeating-task templates, which are hidden generator rows (identified by a non-null `rt1_recurrenceRule`) rather than real todos.
- **Deadline decoding**: `deadline` values are now decoded using Things' packed date format (`(year << 16) | (month << 12) | (day << 7)`) instead of being misread as raw seconds since the Cocoa reference date. The previous decoding produced a nonsensical shared date (e.g. April 23, 2009) for every todo carrying Things' year-4001 "no real deadline" sentinel; that sentinel now correctly decodes to `nil`.
- **Trashed project descendants**: Todos filed (directly, or via a heading) under a trashed project are now excluded from every list except Trash, matching Things' own behavior. Previously only a todo's own `trashed` flag was checked, so items under a trashed project kept appearing everywhere.
- **`someday` vs. a concrete start date**: The `someday` list now excludes todos that also carry a `startDate`, matching how Things itself buckets them (under Anytime/Upcoming instead of Someday).
- **Project resolution through headings**: Todos filed under a heading (rather than directly under a project) now correctly resolve their parent project instead of reporting no project.
- **Untitled todos rendered as a blank line**: `TextOutputFormatter` now renders todos with an empty title as `(no title)` in both list and detail views, instead of a bare checkbox with nothing after it.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Productivity workflow commands**: Added `views`, `template`, `undo`, `focus`, `pick`, `doctor`, and `project audit` command families to support saved filters, reusable task templates, recent-mutation rollback, focused work queues, interactive follow-up selection, local environment diagnostics, and project health auditing.
- **Config-backed local state**: Added JSON-backed storage for saved views, templates, undo history, and weekly review session state under the clings config directory.
- **Command reference and testing docs**: Added `docs/cli/command-reference.md` and `docs/development/testing-and-coverage.md` to document the expanded CLI surface and the source-only Swift Testing coverage workflow.
- **Explicit database paths**: Added public initializers for callers and tests to construct `ThingsDatabase` and `HybridThingsClient` with an explicit Things database path.
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Added macOS build, test, and release-build checks using the Swift 6 toolchain.
- **Project support links**: Added Buy Me a Coffee links to the README.

### Changed

- **CLI help coverage**: Expanded root and subcommand help text with usage guidance and concrete examples across the command tree, and synchronized shell completions with the current top-level and nested commands.
- **README command reference**: Updated README examples and the command table to reflect the current command surface, including the new productivity workflows and diagnostic tooling.
- **Weekly review and focus workflows**: Improved review summaries and added richer project/deadline heuristics for more actionable output from review and focus-oriented commands.
- **Today list selection**: Expanded Today results to include eligible scheduled, overdue, and deadline-based tasks while excluding future and deadline-suppressed items, and preserved manual Today ordering ahead of automatically included items.
- **Public documentation examples**: Replaced personal and environment-specific examples with neutral public-facing examples.

### Fixed

- **Coverage target enforcement**: Extended Swift Testing coverage across Things client, JXA bridge, database, NLP, config-store, formatter, and CLI paths so source-only coverage now stays above the 80% project target.
- **Release docs drift detection**: Adjusted help/completion text and documentation so the release docs check now passes against the expanded CLI surface without false subcommand parsing.
- **CI without Things 3**: Hardened JXA bridge tests so they pass on GitHub-hosted macOS runners where Things 3 is not installed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`today` list overcounting**: Fixed SQLite list filtering so `clings today` no longer over-includes non-today backlog tasks. Root cause and details: [Issue #5](https://github.com/dan-hart/clings/issues/5).
- **Things date encoding mismatch**: Updated `today`/`anytime`/`upcoming` list comparisons to use Things packed date codes instead of "days since 2001", preventing incorrect boundary behavior (see [Issue #5](https://github.com/dan-hart/clings/issues/5)).

### Added

- **Issue-focused regression suite**: Added targeted database regression tests for [Issue #5](https://github.com/dan-hart/clings/issues/5), including list-scope and date-boundary coverage.
- **Issue documentation**: Added `docs/issues/issue-5-today-list-overcount.md` with symptom, root cause, fix summary, and verification commands.
- **Release docs/help audit script**: Added `scripts/release-docs-check.sh` to validate command/help coverage in README and shell completions before release.
- **Release checklist doc**: Added `docs/release/help-readme-docs-checklist.md` with automated and manual pre-release documentation checks.

## [0.2.10] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **Todo creation via AppleScript**: Avoids JXA "Can't make class" failures and schedules `when` dates using the Things `schedule` command.
- **Tag automation reliability**: Corrected tag existence checks so tag add/update/delete/rename and multi-tag updates work again.

## [0.2.9] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **Multi-tag updates via AppleScript**: Set tag names using a comma-separated string to avoid AppleScript type errors when applying multiple tags.

## [0.2.8] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **JXA crash on null modificationDate**: JXA list/search/fetch now safely handles missing modification dates (falls back to creationDate), fixing crashes in `clings filter` and list commands.

### Changed

- **No URL scheme usage**: Removed all Things URL scheme usage across add/update/open/project flows. Tag updates now use AppleScript, and creation uses JXA + AppleScript.
- **Open command disabled**: `clings open` now reports a clear error when invoked because URL schemes are disabled.
- **Bulk tag add**: Bulk tag operations now apply tags via update instead of printing a URL scheme warning.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Project creation**: Create projects via `clings project add`:
  - `clings project add "Project Name"` - Create a new project
  - `clings project add "Sprint" --area "Work" --deadline 2025-01-31` - With options
  - Supports `--notes`, `--area`, `--when`, `--deadline`, and `--tags` flags
  - `clings project list` (or just `clings project`) - List all projects

- **Complete by title search**: Complete todos by searching their title:
  - `clings complete --title "buy milk"` - Search and complete by title
  - `clings complete -t "groceries"` - Short form
  - Shows disambiguation list when multiple todos match
  - Original ID-based completion still works: `clings complete ABC123`

## [0.2.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Tag CRUD commands**: Full tag management via `clings tags` subcommands:
  - `clings tags add "TagName"` - Create a new tag
  - `clings tags delete "TagName"` - Delete a tag (with confirmation unless `--force`)
  - `clings tags rename "OldName" "NewName"` - Rename a tag
  - `clings tags list` - List all tags (also the default when running just `clings tags`)

### Changed

- `clings tags` command now supports subcommands instead of only listing tags.
- Tag CRUD operations use AppleScript (not JXA) for reliable execution.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed

- **`update --tags` silent failure**: Fixed critical bug where `clings update <id> --tags` would report success but never actually apply tags. Root cause was JXA's `todo.tags.push()` silently failing. Now uses Things URL scheme (`things:///update?id=X&tags=Y`) for reliable tag updates.

### Changed

- Tag operations in `updateTodo()` now use URL scheme instead of JXA for reliability.
- Added documentation comments explaining JXA tag limitations.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **`add --area` AppleScript error (-1700)**: Area assignment now correctly sets `todo.area` after `Things.make()` instead of attempting to set it in `withProperties`, which caused a JXA type conversion error.

- **`add --project` silent failure**: Added fallback to `Things.projects.whose()` when `Things.lists.byName()` fails to find a project, fixing cases where todos would silently land in Inbox instead of the specified project.

- **Emoji in title causes error**: Updated string escaping to use JSON encoding, which properly handles all Unicode characters including emoji (e.g., `⚠️`, `🖥️`).

- **Area ignored when project specified**: Removed the conditional that prevented area assignment when a project was also specified. Area and project can now be used together.

### Added

- **`--area` flag for `todo update`**: You can now move existing todos to a different area using `clings todo update <ID> --area "Area Name"`.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed

- Fixed `add` command bugs with area, when/deadline, and project handling.

### Added

- Code quality audit: fixed 98% of clippy warnings, improved documentation.
- Homebrew installation support via `brew install dan-hart/tap/clings`.
